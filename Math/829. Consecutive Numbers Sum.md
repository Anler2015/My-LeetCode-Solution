N can be expressed as k + 1, k + 2, ..., k + i, where k is a positive integer; therefore

N = k * i + (i + 1) * i / 2 =>
N - (i + 1) * i / 2 = k * i, which implies that as long as N - (i + 1) * i / 2 is k times of i, we get a solution corresponding to i; Hence iteration of all possible values of i, starting from 1, will cover all cases of the problem.

Since for i = 1, N can always be written as one number sequence: N, we can start from i = 2, ans = 1.

class Solution:
    def consecutiveNumbersSum(self, num):
        res = 1

        for i in range(2,num):
            if num < i*(i+1)/2:
                break
            if (num - i*(i+1)/2) %i ==0:
                res += 1


        return res
```
